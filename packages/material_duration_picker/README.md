MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalMaterialDurationPickerLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  // ...
),
```

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.timelapse),
  onPressed: () {
    showDurationPicker(
      context: context,
      initialDuration: Duration.zero,
    );
  },
),

DurationPickerDialog(
  durationPickerMode: DurationPickerMode.hm,
  initialDuration: Duration(hours: 1, minutes: 30, seconds: 45),
),

DurationPickerDialog(
  durationPickerMode: DurationPickerMode.hms,
  initialEntryMode: DurationPickerEntryMode.input,
  initialDuration: Duration(hours: 1, minutes: 30, seconds: 45),
),
```

## Additional information

The package was meant to be integrated directly in the Material Widget Library.
This implementation is kept in sync with the changes of the Flutter [time_picker](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/time_picker.dart).
In case the Material and/or Flutter team decides to include it, the package is kept in sync with the Flutter Pull-Request.
